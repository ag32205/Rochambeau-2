My app is a simple Rochambeau game with Lizard and Spock added to the mix. The player chooses whichever they want to play (Rock, Paper ect.). The player then clicks on the "Play" button. Pressing this button makes the AI make a random selection. The results then show up, inidcating who chose what and who won that match. The Player's and AI's total wins and losses are recorded onto their respected scoreboard.
